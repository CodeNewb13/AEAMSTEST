## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **@tensorflow/tfjs**: v4.22.0 - Browser-based ML training
- **@tensorflow/tfjs-node**: v4.22.0 - Server-side optimization
- **plotly.js-dist-min**: v3.1.0 - Training visualizations

### Architecture
```
lib/ml-engine.ts       → Core ML engine with 4 neural networks
components/MLDashboard.tsx → Interactive training dashboard
app/api/ml/            → ML API endpoints
```

### Models
1. **Health Model**: 3-layer dense network (7→32→16→1)
2. **Watering Model**: 3-layer dense network (7→24→12→1)  
3. **Fertilization Model**: 3-layer dense network (7→48→24→3)
4. **Time Series Model**: LSTM network (7→50→25→7)

## 🎯 Usage

### Starting Training
1. Navigate to any farm in the dashboard
2. Scroll to the "ML Dashboard" section
3. Click "Start Training" 
4. Watch real-time metrics and visualizations

### Getting Predictions
Once trained, models automatically provide:
- Health scores (0-100)
- Watering urgency (0-1)
- Fertilization needs (NPK values)
- 24-hour forecasts

### Model Persistence
- Models are saved to browser localStorage
- Training metrics persist across sessions
- Auto-resume from last checkpoint

## 🔧 Configuration

Training parameters can be adjusted:
- **Epochs**: Default 50, adjustable in UI
- **Learning Rate**: Optimized per model
- **Batch Size**: Automatic based on data
- **Validation Split**: 20% for model evaluation

## 📈 Performance

- **Browser Training**: Real-time in user's browser
- **Model Size**: ~2MB total for all 4 networks  
- **Training Time**: ~2-5 minutes for 50 epochs
- **Inference Speed**: <10ms per prediction

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- All training happens locally in the browser
- No sensitive data sent to external ML services
- Models stored locally with user consent
- Authenticated API endpoints only
